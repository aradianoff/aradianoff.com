**aRadianOff.com** Website's Grav User Files is a public repository of all of the user files in the site including blog posts. This site uses [Grav](http://getgrav.org/) as a CMS and a custom child theme of the Antimatter theme grav called aRadianOff. It has multilanguage support for both Spanish and English, and visualizations can easily incorporate the d3.js library as it is already loaded for visualization pages. 

## ToDo List (List of posible improvements to be made): 
- Instead of pagination, use infinite scrolling in Blog
- Instead of sidebar: use a horizontal mini-sidebar after the blog tittle and let the posts appear after that with a different layout.
- Fix breadcrumps line-height (reduce it).
- ~~Plugins that need multilanguage support: JSComments~~.
- ~~Resize visualizations with scaling factor~~. 
- Make a CodeCorner section in projects for future coding projects...
