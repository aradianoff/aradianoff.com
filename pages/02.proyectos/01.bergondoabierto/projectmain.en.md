## Using Public Data Sources to bring Bergondo's information to its citizens. 

===

Bergondo@bierto was born from the curiosity to know the availability level of data that the citizens of Bergondo have about their town. In a society where **openness**, **transparency** and the need of **opening public data** are getting the spotlight.
What information is available about our town and what does it tell us? Here we will try to bring that information closer to the citizens and analyze what the data say.
