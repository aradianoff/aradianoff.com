aRadianOff is the effort of one person. A former marine biology researcher specialized in fisheries management, she decided to leave the world of Academia to dedicate her time to her little kids during their first years and to pursue another of her passions: **Data Analysis and Visualization.** 

Specialized in [R](http://r-project.org), now she spends her free time exploring other tools for interactive visualization of data and to bring public information available on the Web closer to other people.
