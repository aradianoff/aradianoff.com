Here we are with our brand new server and website thanks to [OVH](http://www.ovh.es).

I had been longing for my own server since a long time ago, and now I got one. 
Without having to worry about getting a machine, installing everything, getting a fixed IP address or a DDNS that didn't crash whenever, getting a virtual server has been a great and cheap solution so far. The [VPS de OVH.es](http://www.ovh.es/vps/) service with its [Classic 1](http://www.ovh.es/vps/vps-classic.xml) option, lets you have a virtual server from 2,41â‚¬/month (taxes included). And you can also choose the distribution and OS you want for your sistem (Linux, Windows, ...)

 You buy it, and in less than an hour you have your virtual server and can start messing through SSH. Create users, manage permissions, installing the services and libraries you need... Great for learning also. 
 
Lets see how it goes.
