Today I released the first version of the [reCAPTCHA Contact Plugin](https://github.com/aradianoff/recatpchacontact) for [GRAV](http://getgrav.org). 

===

reCAPTCHA Contact is a Grav v0.9.33+ plugin based in the [Simple Contact plugin](https://github.com/nunopress/grav-plugin-simple_contact) from NunoPress LLC that adds a contact form in Grav pages with [Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/) validation to filter Spam Robots and multilang support. Currently both Spanish (es) and English (en) translations are included by default.  If someone wants to help translating it to other languages you can send me the [languages.yaml](https://github.com/aradianoff/recatpchacontact/blob/master/languages.yaml) file with the translations (or fork the project and send me a pull request). 

It is my first attempt at a Grav Plugin. Initially, I just wanted to make some minor custom modifications to the Simple Contact plugin to add multilang support and the reCAPTCHA to the contact form in this site, but I figured that maybe those changes could be useful to other people looking to add a contact form to their site, so I decided to convert them into a functional plugin. So here it is, available in my GitHub repository:
